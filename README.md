I'm Felix - a developer, traveller, lycra clad cyclist, and spicy food enthusiast. I tried my hand at a few things following my graduation from univeristy with a 2:1 honours degrees in Forensic Science. I tasted and traded tea for 6 months, taught English in three continents over a 4 year period and ran an international hostel and live music venue in Japan for a year and a half.

Following a three month trip around South America after saying goodbye to Japan, I returned to the UK with the dream of becoming a developer and so I dived head first in the world of programming.

I have recently graduated from a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp at Makers Academy and I am looking for a **Full Stack Junior Developer** role in an exciting company. I am looking for somewhere I can continue to learn and develop my skills while working with people who are passionate about the languages they use and the projects they work on.

## Skills

#### Communication

Communication has been a integral part of all my previous roles and as a developer,  I believe it is very important to be able to succinctly communicate your ideas, views and concepts to your colleagues and clients.

When I was an English teacher, it was my job to talk to and engage not only with students, but also with their parents. I learnt that it was not just verbal communication that was important because I frequently found myself communicating with people who didn't have a strong grasp of the English language. I learnt how to overcome language barriers through lots of different types of communication and as a result was able to build strong relationships with my students and their parents.  

#### Problem Solving

I gained valuable problem solving and analytical skills while doing my degree in Forensic Science. I found that the modules that relied heavily on physical science and analytics, were the ones I enjoyed the most and excelled at.



- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)

- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
